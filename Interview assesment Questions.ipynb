    "# Q.2 \n",
    "# Python Task 1\n",
    "# Question : Car Matrix Generation\n",
    "# Under the function named generate_car_matrix write a logic that takes the dataset-1.csv as a DataFrame. Return a new DataFrame that follows the following rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "# values from id_2 as columns\n",
    "# values from id_1 as index\n",
    "# dataframe should have values from car column\n",
    "# diagonal values should be 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q.3 \n",
    "\n",
    "# Question : Car Type Count Calculation\n",
    "# Create a Python function named get_type_count that takes the dataset-1.csv as a DataFrame. Add a new categorical column car_type based on values of the column car:\n",
    "\n",
    "# low for values less than or equal to 15,\n",
    "# medium for values greater than 15 and less than or equal to 25,\n",
    "# high for values greater than 25.\n",
    "# Calculate the count of occurrences for each car_type category and return the result as a dictionary. Sort the dictionary alphabetically based on keys.\n",

    "# Q.4 \n",
    "\n",
    "# Question : Bus Count Index Retrieval\n",
    "# Create a Python function named get_bus_indexes that takes the dataset-1.csv as a DataFrame. The function should identify and return the indices as a list (sorted in ascending order) where the bus values are greater than twice the mean value of the bus column in the DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q.5 \n",
    "# Question : Route Filtering\n",
    "# Create a python function filter_routes that takes the dataset-1.csv as a DataFrame. The function should return the sorted list of values of column route for which the average of values of truck column is greater than 7.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q.6 \n",
    "# Question 5: Matrix Value Modification\n",
    "# Create a Python function named multiply_matrix that takes the resulting DataFrame from Question 1, as input and modifies each value according to the following logic:\n",
    "\n",
    "# If a value in the DataFrame is greater than 20, multiply those values by 0.75,\n",
    "# If a value is 20 or less, multiply those values by 1.25.\n",

    "\n",
    "# Question : Time Check\n",
    "# You are given a dataset, dataset-2.csv, containing columns id, id_2, and timestamp (startDay, startTime, endDay, endTime). The goal is to verify the completeness of the time data by checking whether the timestamps for each unique (id, id_2) pair cover a full 24-hour period (from 12:00:00 AM to 11:59:59 PM) and span all 7 days of the week (from Monday to Sunday).\n",

    "# Create a function that accepts dataset-2.csv as a DataFrame and returns a boolean series that indicates if each (id, id_2) pair has incorrect timestamps. The boolean series must have multi-index (id, id_2).\n",

    "# Create a function named calculate_distance_matrix that takes the dataset-3.csv as input and generates a DataFrame representing distances between IDs.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The resulting DataFrame should have cumulative distances along known routes, with diagonal values set to 0. If distances between toll locations A to B and B to C are known, then the distance from A to C should be the sum of these distances. Ensure the matrix is symmetric, accounting for bidirectional distances between toll locations (i.e. A to B is equal to B to A).\n",

    "# Q.9 \n",
    "# Question : Unroll Distance Matrix\n",
    "# Create a function unroll_distance_matrix that takes the DataFrame created in Question 1. The resulting DataFrame should have three columns: columns id_start, id_end, and distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "# All the combinations except for same id_start to id_end must be present in the rows with their distance values from the input DataFrame.\n",

    "# Question : Finding IDs within Percentage Threshold\n",
    "# Create a function find_ids_within_ten_percentage_threshold that takes the DataFrame created in Question 2 and a reference value from the id_start column as an integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Calculate average distance for the reference value given as an input and return a sorted list of values from id_start column which lie within 10% (including ceiling and floor) of the reference value's average.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q.11 \n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a function calculate_toll_rate that takes the DataFrame created in Question 2 as input and calculates toll rates based on vehicle types.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The resulting DataFrame should add 5 columns to the input DataFrame: moto, car, rv, bus, and truck with their respective rate coefficients. The toll rates should be calculated by multiplying the distance with the given rate coefficients for each vehicle type:\n",

    "# Create a function named calculate_time_based_toll_rates that takes the DataFrame created in Question 3 as input and calculates toll rates for different time intervals within a day.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The resulting DataFrame should have these five columns added to the input: start_day, start_time, end_day, and end_time.\n",
    "\n",
    "# start_day, end_day must be strings with day values (from Monday to Sunday in proper case)\n",
